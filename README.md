# Caffeine Tracker
Amber Brownstein and Qing Chen's entry for She Innovates 2020.

A web application that calculates how much caffeine is in the user's system, based of various factors, such as body weight and caffeine intake over time. The application will also provide the user with helpful advice, such as how much more caffeine they can consume before beginning to experience adverse side effects and how long it will take for caffeine to leave their system. Using the half life of caffeine and the volume of blood per body weight, CoffeeMeter is able to calculate the mg/L of caffeine currently in a user's body. It also uses the derived logarithmic function to calculate the number of hours before these levels return to normal.
